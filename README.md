## Idea
An e-waste management system refers to the infrastructure, policies, and practices put in place to handle electronic waste (e-waste) in an environmentally responsible manner. As technology advances and electronic devices become more pervasive, the disposal of obsolete or unwanted electronics has become a significant environmental concern due to the hazardous materials they often contain, such as heavy metals and toxic chemicals.
